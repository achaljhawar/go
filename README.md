# Alby Go

A simple lightning mobile wallet interface that works great with [Alby Hub](https://albyhub.com) or any other [NWC](https://nwc.dev) wallet service.

## Development

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

### Notifications

Push notifications are only available when running the app on a **physical device** using the following commands:

For iOS:

`yarn ios:device`

For Android:

`yarn android:device`

**Note:** Notifications do not work in the Expo Go app. You must run the app on a standalone build or a device using the above commands.
